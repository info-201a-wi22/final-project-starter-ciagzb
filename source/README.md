# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[Calculation_for_p02.R](./Calculation_for_p02.R) | Calculation of 5 values we have
|[data_access.R](./data_access.R) | The code to access data
|[p02 Chart.R](./p02%20Chart.R) | The first chart we drew (bar chart)
|[p02 boxplot chart.R](./p02%20boxplot%20chart.R) | The second chart we drew (boxplot chart)
|[p02-line_graph.R](./p02-line_graph.R) | The third chart we drew (line chart)
|[p02_code(For Cleaning up data and Calculations).R](./p02_code(For%20Cleaning%20up%20data%20and%20Calculations).R) | The code we have use to come up final dataset


# DEVELOPER NOTE 1: About ...
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories, which is fine.
* If you use sub-directories, plese briefly describe them

# DEVELOPER NOTE 2:  Clear and Concise Documentation
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore,
aim for clarity and conciseness.
* When done, be sure to delete these NOTE sections and the example CSV file (which are intended for you, of course, not your audience!)
